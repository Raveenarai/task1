      <p>Samsung has been launched its first flip smartphones on 20th February 2020 called Samsung Galaxy Z Flip (Model number: SM-F700FZPDDBT). This is the first flip smartphone in India. The Galaxy Z Flip is a beautiful piece of hardware inside and out. It’s an engineering feat that Samsung has succeeded in cramming so much hardware into this phone.<br>

        The camera is really beautiful with comparable results to Samsung’s 2019 flagships. There’s no dedicated telephoto camera, but it’s one of the trade-offs that come with the limited space. Battery size is another one of these trade-offs, but even the lackluster battery life is something we can live with<br>
        
        The biggest concern is that folding smartphones are way too fragile — the screen scratches easily, you never know when something is going to find its way inside that hinge and ruin it, and there is no water resistance at all. These are a lot of practical downsides to something that costs so much money.
